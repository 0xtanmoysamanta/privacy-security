Why this repo exists

This document outlines how @your‑org / your‑project approaches privacy, security, and the transition to quantum‑resilient cryptography. It’s meant for contributors, users, auditors, and future‑you.


---

Scope & threat model

Assets

Source code, CI/CD secrets, build artifacts

User PII (minimal by design), telemetry (pseudonymous), configuration

Infrastructure: cloud accounts, containers, K/V secrets, signing keys


Adversaries

Opportunistic attackers, credential‑stuffers

Supply‑chain actors (malicious dependencies, typosquatting)

Targeted actors with phishing/social‑engineering capability

Long‑term collectors ("harvest‑now, decrypt‑later")


Assumptions

Network and endpoints are not inherently trusted

Keys and secrets rotate; compromise can happen; we plan for blast‑radius limits



---

Security principles

Least privilege by default

Defense in depth (controls at code, build, deploy, runtime)

Privacy by design (collect less, retain less)

Crypto agility (easy to swap cryptography)

Secure by default configs; unsafe flags require explicit justification

Automate (tests, scanning, policy gates)



---

Baseline controls (checklist)

[ ] 2FA enforced for all contributors (FIDO2/U2F preferred)

[ ] Mandatory code review; branch protection + required checks

[ ] Secrets scanning (pre‑commit + CI) and blocked on failure

[ ] Dependency scanning (SCA) + allowlist for new transitive risks

[ ] SBOM produced on every build (e.g., CycloneDX)

[ ] Signed commits and signed releases (Sigstore/Keyless or GPG)

[ ] Reproducible builds where feasible

[ ] Infrastructure as Code with policy‑as‑code gates (e.g., OPA)

[ ] Centralized logging with tamper‑evident storage

[ ] Key rotation policy + short‑lived credentials (OIDC where possible)


> See repo folder /security/ for config examples (hooks, CI, policies).




---

Data protection

Data minimization

Collect only what’s required; document purpose & retention


At rest

Default: Encrypt volumes, databases, buckets

Key management: Cloud KMS/HSM; separate roles for use vs. admin


In transit

TLS 1.3 preferred; enforce modern ciphers

Certificate pinning for client apps when practical


Backups

Encrypted, immutable snapshots, periodic restore tests



---

Identity & access

Enforce hardware security keys for maintainers

Use OIDC‑based workload identity (no static cloud creds in CI)

Role‑based access; just‑in‑time elevation; session recording for prod

Automated access reviews every 90 days; disable inactive accounts



---

Secure development

Before commit

Pre‑commit: secret scan, lint, format, license checks


CI gates

Unit/integration tests must pass

SAST + SCA + IaC scan; block on criticals

SBOM generated and attached to artifacts


Runtime

Minimal base images, non‑root, seccomp/AppArmor

Read‑only file systems; drop capabilities; egress allowlists

Observability: metrics, tracing, structured logs with PII redaction



---

Supply‑chain security

Pinned dependencies + checksum/attestations

Prefer well‑maintained libs; avoid single‑maintainer critical deps

Provenance attestations (SLSA ≥ level 2 target; keep improving)

Verify third‑party containers with signatures (Cosign)



---

Post‑Quantum (PQ) readiness

Why it matters

Adversaries may harvest now and decrypt later once large fault‑tolerant quantum computers arrive. Protect long‑lived data (PII, secrets, recorded traffic).


Recommended algorithms (high‑level)

KEM (key exchange): NIST‑standardized lattice‑based KEM (e.g., Kyber)

Signatures: NIST‑standardized lattice‑based signatures (e.g., Dilithium) and hash‑based (SPHINCS+) where small keys aren’t critical


Migration strategy

1. Inventory cryptography (protocols, libs, endpoints, certs)


2. Classify data by confidentiality lifetime


3. Enable crypto agility (abstract providers; config‑driven suites)


4. Hybrid key exchange (X25519+PQ KEM) during transition where supported


5. Test interoperability in staging with PQ‑ready TLS/VPN/SSH builds


6. Rotate artifacts (code‑signing, tokens, db keys) on a schedule


7. Monitor standards & libraries; update when stable and widely supported



What we won’t do

No home‑rolled cryptography; no unaudited PQ primitives

No over‑promising on timelines; we follow well‑supported releases


Notes

QKD is out of scope for this project; we rely on software cryptography and open standards

Incident response

Report intake: security@your‑org.example or GitHub Security Advisories

Triage SLA: acknowledge within 72h; severity‑based response

Playbooks: credential leak, dependency vuln, prod compromise, PII exposure

Post‑mortems: blameless, published summaries for user‑impacting incidents



---

Reporting a vulnerability

Please create a GitHub Security Advisory or email security@your‑org.example with:

Affected component & version

Reproduction steps / PoC

Impact assessment (CIA triad)

Your contact for follow‑up


We support coordinated disclosure and will credit researchers unless anonymity is requested.


---

Roadmap

[ ] Enforce keyless signing (Sigstore) for all build artifacts

[ ] Adopt PQ‑hybrid TLS for internal services

[ ] Achieve SLSA level ≥ 3 for critical pipelines

[ ] Periodic red‑team & phishing simulations

[ ] Automated data‑retention enforcement
